# HW 06: Weather Dashboard - sam.kim

## Overview

This is a simple weather dashboard app that uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for any user inputted cities.

## Functionality

When a city is searched, the city's current weather conditions as well as 5-day forecast are retrieved from OpenWeather.

The searched city is added to the search history and to localStorage so that if you open the weather dashboard again, you are presented with the last searched city's forecast. If you click on one of the cities in the search history, you are presented with the weather conditions for that city.

The weather icons and weather descriptions are also retrieved from OpenWeather. And the UV index is colored to indicate its severity.

The following comp was initially provided to demonstrate the desired functionality for the dashboard. The front-end is built with Bootstrap and features custom CSS. The site has also been customized for mobile devices using Bootstrap utilities and classes for a responsive, mobile-friendly layout.
